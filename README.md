# Hungry Dog

This game was created as part of a 4-day solo hackathon project.

Instructions:

- The objective of the game is to catch as many dog-friendly fruits and vegetables (e.g. apples, bananas, carrots, watermelon, strawberries), while avoiding fruits and vegetables that are harmful to dogs (e.g. onions, garlic, grapes, cherries).
- The player begins with 3 lives. Not catching a dog-friendly fruit or vegetable has no effect on the number of lives, but catching a harmful fruit or vegetable reduces the number of lives by 1.
- There are 5 levels of difficulty. Each fruit earns more points at harder levels.
- Move the player using the arrows on the keyboard.
- Have fun!
