Instructions:

- The objective of the game is to catch as many dog-friendly fruits and vegetables (e.g. apples, bananas, carrots, watermelon, strawberries), while avoiding fruits and vegetables that are harmful to dogs (e.g. onions, garlic, grapes, cherries).
- The player begins with 3 lives. Not catching a dog-friendly fruit or vegetable has no effect on the number of lives, but catching a harmful fruit or vegetable reduces the number of lives by 1.
- There are 5 levels of difficulty. Each fruit earns more points at harder levels.
- Move the player using the arrows on the keyboard.
- Have fun!

To Play the Game Locally:

1. After cloning to your local machine, install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start it up! `npm run start-dev` will start a server running at http://localhost:8080. Head on over there in your browser, and navigate to the 'public/' directory, which is where the Phaser application is served.
